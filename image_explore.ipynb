    "- We rely on others to build functions without being able to comprehensively understand exactly what's happening in the packages/backend. In industry, this reliance can lead to liability issues, which explains why organizations can be reluctant to move from vendors to open-source technology.\n",
    "- From statistical analysis, it is critical to know assumptions, but in AI/ML we may not be following the mathematical assumptions which leads to spurious results that cannot be replicated\n",
    "- Answers on the internet can be overly complicated - part of the reward and fun is to figure out simple things\n",
    "- Opens the door for future exploration - classes, additional reading\n",
    "- Doesn't hurt to have ambitious scoping as long as the steps are in sequence and clear, and we can stop at any point to have tangible results\n",
    "- Collaboration functionality on GitHub and their different approaches (cloning, forking, adding collaborators)\n",
    "- Start wherever, keep going: just start\n",
    "\n",
    "## Future Improvements\n",
    "- For more complex steps: Use existing package functions to see tangible effects, then dissect source code together to parse how things work\n",
    "- Build up variety of projects: Different levels of entry in data science projects, include more/all of the data-gathering-to-model-monitoring lifecycle\n",
    "    - Data quality is hard to assess and improve! What are best practices?\n",
    "    - Model assumptions: what are common ones in the project's area? What mathematical assumptions are most important? (i.e. computer vision here; for example, to run regression, you need enough data for meaningful results, and there are also data type requirements - categorical or continuous - for result interpretation to be valid)\n",
    "- Perhaps structure as weekly big-group pair/mob-programming sessions, or offer that as a way to structure the group sessions\n",
    "- What to do with real, dirty data?"
